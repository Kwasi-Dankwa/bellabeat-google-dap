# Insights
```{r}
# pull insights from data through summary
merged_data %>%
  select(totalsteps, totaldistance, veryactiveminutes, fairlyactiveminutes, lightlyactiveminutes, sedentaryminutes, calories)%>%
  summary()

# insights show that The average total steps are 7,638 steps. CDC recommended daily steps should be around 10,000 steps a day. However, NIH and CDC have recently provided research showing that more than 8,000 steps can also provide improvement in health when meeting daily steps.  (CDC and NIH)

# The average very active minutes are 21.16 minutes while the sedentary minutes are an average of 991.20 minutes or 16.52 hours. Users' average for light activities is 192.8 minutes or 3.2 hours. This means they are spending most of their time doing light activities compared to the other categories. 

# It is advised that spending more than 7-10 hours sedentary is bad for your health. 
# It is recommended to do an average of 30 minutes a day of moderate activity and 75 minutes a week of vigorous activity.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
