I will assume the role of a junior data analyst. You will imagine you are working for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, and meet different characters and team members. In order to answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.

## ASK

In this phase, we need to identify who the key stakeholders are. In this case, we have the following stakeholders: 

- **Urška Sršen:** Co-founder of Bellabeat - Chief Creative Officer - initiated the project.
-  **Sando Mur:** Cofounder of Bellabeat - Mathematician - Member of Bellabeat executive team
-  **Bellabeat marketing analytics team:** Bellabeat's analyst team - Helping to guide the company's marketing strategy

### Guiding Questions
* What are some trends in smart device usage?
*  How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
*   How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

## Prepare
Sršen encourages you to use public data that explores smart device users’ daily habits. She points you to a specific data set:
FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius): This Kaggle data set
contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of
personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes
information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.
Sršen tells you that this data set might have some limitations, and encourages you to consider adding another data to help
address those limitations as you begin to work more with this data.
